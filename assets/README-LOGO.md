# JZGMNHS Logo Installation Instructions

## To add the school logo to the login page:

1. Save your JZGMNHS logo image as: `assets/jzgmnhs-logo.png`
2. The logo should be approximately 200x200 pixels for best results
3. The image will be automatically displayed as a circular logo (120x120px) on the login page
4. If the logo file is not found, it will fallback to the school emoji (üè´)

## Current Logo Path Expected:
```
c:\xampp\htdocs\tms\TMS-v.1.0.1\assets\jzgmnhs-logo.png
```

## Logo Requirements:
- Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- Size: 200x200 pixels recommended
- Background: Transparent PNG works best
- File name: jzgmnhs-logo.png (exactly as specified)

The login page has been updated to automatically use your logo image once you place it in the correct location.
